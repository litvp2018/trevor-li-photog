		Hello world! <br>
		<br>
		This first post marks the beginning of my website. It's going to be short one but I'll follow up this post with a proper one very shortly. Before I post new material from my upcoming photo walks, I'll most likely share 			some photos from my trip to Iceland in 2018 as well as photos from my trip to China over the summer of this year. With regards to the above photos, they're all from a roll of Suji Superia 400 that I shot in China. These 			three in particular were three consecutive ones that I took near Guilin, China. <br>
		<br>
		I also wanted share with you how I post-process photos taken on film. It's a fairly complicated, multi-step process that's based around getting a good scan from my DSLR. (Yes, I use my digital camera to scan analog film, 			but the scans still retain the unique look of film nevertheless.) Below are a series of photos that shows the major steps that I take: 1. The raw phto that I get off of my DSLR of the film negative itself. 2. Rough colour 		inversion. 3. Cropping and straightening. 4. JPEG processing, final colour grading, manual dust removal, and sharpening. (And in this case, 5. resizing for display on my website and  a bit more sharpening.)
