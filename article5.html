		"The film's not very interesting and is more or less just me dipping my toes into the world of cinematography. I tried to emulate the look of Super 16 mm film but unfortunately, YouTube's 
		compression algorithm definitely affects how the grain looks. I might upload in 4K in the future to avoid this problem."

		This short film was shot on April 25th and was created just so that I could get an overall feel of the film-making process. This was the first time that I had used a video editing program other
		than Windows Movie Maker which was a crucial step for me to get into the world of cinematography. So far I've been trying out Shotcut, a free, open source video editing program. Although the
		program is fairly basic, it has enough features for a beginner like me while still having a relatively shallow learning curve.
		<br>
		<br>
		Gear used for this film: Nikon D3300 + Nikkor 50mm f/1.4 AI-S + Macro extension tubes.
		<br>
		<br>
		Edited with Shotcut 20.04.12.

		This is how Shotcut's interface looks. It's fairly straight-forward and intuitive to use.

		A collection of stills taken from the film.	I am fairly satisfied with how the colour grading turned out. I think the grading in several of the scenes imitate the look of Super 16 mm film pretty well,
		especially for a first attempt.
