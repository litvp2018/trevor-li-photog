		You may be asking; what exactly is this site for? To put in shortly, this site will act as a blog for my upcoming photo walks, general photography articles, and posts where I will share with you
		some of the photos that I've taken over the years. I hope to maintain a 50/50 split between talking about film photography as well as digital photography.
