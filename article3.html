		<h2>first snow of 2019</h2>
		
		<p>
		The following images were taken during the afternoon of November 7th and most of the snow in the photos was already there
		from the day before. However, it did start snowing again when I was taking photos and thus I had to head back in before
		my camera got soaked. I was pretty surprised by how many of the plants were still alive at this point. (They remained green
		for up to a week after this first snowfall.) This was also the first proper time I got to use my newly purchased Nikkor 
		35mm f/1.4 AI-S that I bought in Hong Kong over the summer.

		The Nikkor 35mm f/1.4 has very distinctive bokeh (the blurry bits) unlike any other lens that I've tried. The majority of people will
		find that this bokeh looks too "busy" but I think it adds some amount of visual interest. This lens can also sometimes
		display an unusually high amount of longitudinal chromatic abberation, (see the rainbow coloured edges
		most prominent in the bokeh,) which more or less expected in a lens with such an odd design.

		My strawberry plants have been hidden under a layer of leaves from my Japanese maple tree. In contrast to the above
		photo, this one doesn't seem to have any visible chromatic abberation despite being shot at the same aperture.

		<b>Left:</b> a fairly standard "double Gauss" design used by Nikon for virtually all their 50mm lenses. Note the symmetry between the front and rear elements.
		<b>Right:</b> The lens design created for the Nikkor 35mm f/1.4 AI-S. Its unusual design was largely influenced by Nikon's decision
		to create this lens with a front filter thread size of 52mm. That is, the maximum size of the front element was 
		constrained by this and being a fairly fast wide-angle lens, this meant that a lot of optical engineering was needed to meet 
		the requirement. <br>
		<br> This lens also has what's called "floating elements", or what Nikon calls the "Close Range Correction (CRC) system".
		This means that one or more lens elements move independently from the main focusing helicoid. As you turn the focusing ring,
		the distance between the elements themselves will actually change, allowing for better performance across different focusing 
		distances. Although this type of technology was new and revolutionary in 1981, it's now a fairly common feature of modern 
		lenses (along with low dispersion glass, optical image stabilization, and a whole plethora of other features.) <br>
		<br>
		Side note: Nikon has a series of 71 articles called "The Thousand and One Nights" on 71 different lenses produced throughout the history of the company.
		They're a cool read if you're interested in the design aspects and development of these lenses like I am.<br>
