		<h2>Pepper Seedlings</h2>
		
		<p>
		Not much writing this time. About a week and a half ago, I planted some habanero seeds in an egg carton and they decided to sprout
		a few days ago. The seeds were actually taken from my first habanero plant which I bought in the spring of last year. I had saved
		about two dozen seeds in a small paper pouch and they sat in a cupboard for 7 months in the dark. I'm going to include some photos of 
		the seedlings below; they look a bit pale in these photos but after putting them in front of a South-facing window, I can confirm 
		that they're now a healthy, darker shade of green. I'll post more photos once the first couple sets of true leaves grow in.

		On a side note, it appears that both a mayapple plant and a trillium plant have survived their first winter in my backyard. 
		I checked 2 days ago and found two very small yet identifiable shoots. Moreover, unless the other mayapple/trillium plants have died,
		I should be seeing more shoots coming up soon. (Which also means more stuff to photograph.)
