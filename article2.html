		<h2>summer Iceland trip 2018</h2>
		
		<p> 
		In 2018, my family and I stayed in Iceland from the 2nd to 9th of August. During the week long trip we visited several attractions located
		within the city of Reykjavík as well as other destinations located further South towards the villages of Skógar and Vík. Here is a
		collection of some photos (both film and digital) that I have arranged in a roughly chronological order. Note that some of the photos below 
		were included not because of their artistic value but rather for the sake of inclusion and completeness. Fun fact: I carried only a single lens
		for my DSLR for the entire trip: my Nikon Nikkor 35mm f/1.8G DX.

		Halfway through the flight to Reykjavík and just before dawn, we ran into something that I was totally not expecting:
		Noctilucent clouds! They are a type of meterological phenomenon that is extremely rare  and not very well understood. They're created when light 
		is reflected off high altitude ice crystals <b>(76-85 km in the mesosphere!)</b> and are only visible during just before sunrise and after sunset. 
		In order for them to be visible, sunlight must only illuminate the upper layers of the atmosphere while the the lower parts are still blocked by 
		Earth's own shadow. They're also not a true type of cloud despite their name and appearance.

		Here's one of the first photos that I took after I arrived in Reykjavík. This photo was taken at Tjörnin, a small park located across from
		Reykjavík's city hall.

		There was a large parking lot beside the disused building of the Iceland Academy of the Arts that was covered in graffiti. You can see the building
		to the far right of the photo. I was able to find graffiti pretty much everywhere I went in Reykjavík, even in the most visible places along major roads.

		The famous Sun Voyager sculpture created by Jón Gunnar Árnason in 1990. It was very hard to find a day where there weren't any people hanging around the
		sculpture during sunset.

		Long exposure of the Hraunfossar near Húsafell which flows into the Hvítá river. A couple paces to the right of where this photo was taken and 
		you will end up at another waterfall, the Barnafoss. There's an old story about two boys from a nearby farm drowning when they tried to cross the Barnafoss by
		walking over a natural bridge. Whether or not this story is true or not can't be confirmed but it's entirely plausible.

		The actual Canon Canonet QL17 that I used during this trip. It previously had a faulty shutter and light meter, both of which I fixed shortly before I left
		for the trip. I had to completely disassemble the camera and I was worried during the whole trip that something would break again. Luckily everything 
		went perfectly.
